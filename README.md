The Weather Forecast Web Application is a dynamic and responsive web project developed as part of an internship program focused on API integration. The core objective of the project is to demonstrate the use of real-time data fetching from a public API and dynamically updating a web interface to present that data in a user-friendly format.This project utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API, a free and publicly accessible web service that provides current weather data for cities across the globe. The application is designed to be fully functional, lightweight, and easily accessible through any modern web browser, making it ideal for educational purposes, internship demonstrations, or integration into larger applications.
